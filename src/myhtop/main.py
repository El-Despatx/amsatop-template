    If you havenâ€™t implemented the solution yet and want to see a simulated version of amsatop running
    on your computer, you can modify the following line:
        htop = Amsatop()
    to:
        htop = None

    This will display a "fake" version for testing purposes.
    Additionally, you can adjust the refresh interval to control
    how often the process list updates. If you'd prefer to view a static snapshot of the current processes,
    we recommend setting the refresh value to 120 seconds.
